<b>Donate</b><br/>
The objective of this report is purely informative. <b>However, I encourage those who have the financial means to donate to a 
<a href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/"><i>Red Cross</i> or <i>Red Crescent Society</i></a>, preferably in a highly affected region.</b> <br/>
You can also donate to <a href="https://www.msf.org/donate"><i>Doctors without Borders</i></a>. They provide medical assistance to people affected by conflict, epidemics, disasters, or exclusion from healthcare. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> The number of cases is probably <i>underreported due to asymptomatic infection and lack of testing in certain regions</i>. This means that the lethality of the virus is probably lower than the numbers currently indicate. Furthermore, <i>reporting of data may lag</i>, which means there might be outliers in the daily data, i.e. days with zero cases or conversely multiples of the actual amount. Additionaly, due to organizational contraints, the current numbers may refer to previous dates in certain regions. As of December 14th 2020, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) only reports weekly data. That was incompatible with the way this page works with data and creates graphical representation. Therefore, this dashboard transiotioned to the daily data by Our World in Data.
